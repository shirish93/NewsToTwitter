#News to Twitter
This python app monitors a given news site, looks for mentions of popular
people on Twitter, and :
* 1) Lets them know they have been mentioned
* 2)... with the context they they mentioned in, with the names replaced with twitter handles.



##TODO

* Mine newspapers: Easy
* Connect news to people: harder
* Tweet mentions: easy
* Possible to make a firefox/chrome addon that adds people's twitter handles to their news mentions?
